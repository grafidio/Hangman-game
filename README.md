# Hangman-game
Coded this independently.
Used the following pseudo code before starting to write the actual code. \n

Find long list of random generated strings, \n
get computer to pick a random word from that list\n
computer shows in terminal how long the chosen word is with length function e.g. 6 characters\n

set lives to be a certain number \n
while lives >=1 : \n
 user inputs 1 character string \n
if the user selected character is found in the word \n
	 tell user what the index of that character is \n
    if not found in the word \n
	lives -= 1 \n
print (“ you lose”)
